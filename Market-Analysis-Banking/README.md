## Market Analysis in Banking Domain
A marketing campaign was done to convince potential customers to invest in a bank term deposit product. The marketing campaign was done through phone calls, and often the same customer was contacted more than once, in order to assess if they wanted to invest in the bank term deposit or not. 

Using Spark Scala, perform the marketing analysis of the data generated by this campaign.

### Analysis Steps

1. Load data and create a Spark data frame

2. Give marketing success rate as (No. of people subscribed / total no. of entries)

3. Give the maximum, mean, and minimum age of the average targeted customer

4. Check the quality of customers by checking average balance, median balance of customers

5. Check if age matters in marketing subscription for deposit

6. Check if marital status mattered for a subscription to deposit

7. Check if age and marital status together mattered for a subscription to deposit scheme
