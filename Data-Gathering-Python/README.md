# Data Gathering Project using Python

## Overview
Two notebooks were created for downloading [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/) demographics data and COVID-19 data to be used for the Capstone project. The <a href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">Beautiful Soup</a> Python library is used for scraping the CSV files names from the Gapminder and COVID-19 GitHub web interfaces.

The data pipeline for consumption of these files are detailed in the <a href="https://github.com/mwalbers1/DEND-Capstone-Project" target="_blank">Capstone Project</a> repository.

## Gapminder data 

The [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/) data is a global collection of demographic data collected on over 100 countries throughout the world across five continents.  The repository for the Gapminder files is located at [Gapminder gapminder-offline](https://github.com/Gapminder/gapminder-offline/tree/development/ddf--gapminder--systema_globalis)

The Jupyter notebook for downloading the Gapminder CSV files is at <a href="https://github.com/mwalbers1/Data-Engineering-Projects/blob/main/Data-Gathering-Python/gm_data_gathering_latest.ipynb" target="_blank">gm_data_gathering_latest</a><br/>

### COVID-19 data 

The daily COVID-19 CSV files are in the <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports/" target="_blank">CSSEGISandData/COVID-19</a> GitHub repository.  

The Jupyter notebook for downloading the the COVID-19 CSV files is at <a href="https://github.com/mwalbers1/Data-Engineering-Projects/blob/main/Data-Gathering-Python/covid-19_data_gathering.ipynb" target="_blank">covid-19_data_gathering</a><br/>
