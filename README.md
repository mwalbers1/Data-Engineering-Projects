# Data Engineering Projects
A repository of projects for the design and development of data models, data warehouses and data lakes, and automated data pipelines for processing massive data sets. 
<br/><br/>

[Data Gathering Project using Python](Data-Gathering-Python)<br/>
-&nbsp;Use Python Beautiful Soup package library to extract Gapminder and COVID-19 data files.<br/>

[Data Lake Project - Apache Spark and AWS S3](https://github.com/mwalbers1/DEND-Data-Lake) <br/>-&nbsp;Create data lake for storage of large volumes of data. Ingest json files, denormalize json data and load into fact and dimension tables. Then upload
data into AWS S3 in parquet format.<br/>

[Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra](Cassandra%20NoSQL)<br/>
-&nbsp;Ingest large amounts of data into NoSQL database called Apache Cassandra. Design is based on query-first approach for design of load processes into data tables in Cassandra.<br/>

[Data Warehouse Project](Data-Warehouse-Project)<br/>
-&nbsp;Build ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) pipeline for music streaming data which resides in AWS (Amazon Web Services) S3 as JSON files. Load the relevant data attributes into staging tables residing on an AWS Redshift cluster data warehouse server.

[HDFS Command Line](HDFS-Command-Line)<br/>
 -&nbsp;A practice project for HDFS Command line.

[Data Ingestion Kafka and Flume](Data-Ingestion_Kafka_Flume)<br/>
-&nbsp;This project is from SimpliLearn Big Data Hadoop and Spark Developer certification. It details steps for setting up a data ingestion process between Kafka and Flume.<br/>

[Market Analysis in Banking Domain](Market-Analysis-Banking)<br/>
-&nbsp;Assessment project for SimpliLearn Big Data Hadoop and Spark Developer certification. Use Apache Spark to analyze the results of marketing campaign performed by a Portuguese banking institution.<br/>

[Data Pipeline with Airflow](Data-Pipeline-Airflow)<br/>
-&nbsp;An Apache Airflow data pipeline performs ETL from JSON files in AWS S3 to AWS Redshift Data Warehouse<br/>
