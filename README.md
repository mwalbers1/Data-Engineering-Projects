[Capstone Project](https://github.com/mwalbers1/DEND-Capstone-Project) &nbsp;&nbsp; :white_check_mark:<br/>
-&nbsp;The final project to Udacity's Data Engineering Nanodegree<br/>

[Data Gathering Project using Python](Data-Gathering-Python) &nbsp;&nbsp; :white_check_mark:<br/>
-&nbsp;A prerequisite project for the Udacity Data Engineering Capstone project.  Use Python Beautiful Soup package library to extract Gapminder and COVID-19 data files.<br/>

[Data Modeling with Postgres](PostgreSQL%20ETL) &nbsp;&nbsp; :white_check_mark:<br/>
-&nbsp;Design and create data model for fictitious music company called Sparkify based on the STAR schema. Build Python ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) process in Python to load the data model. This project was for the Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree.<br/>
