# Data-Engineering-Projects
A repository of projects for the design and development of data models, data warehouses and data lakes, automated data pipelines for processing massive data sets.

## Projects
---
[Data Modeling with Postgres](PostgreSQL%20ETL/README.md) &nbsp;&nbsp; :white_check_mark:<br/>
-&nbsp;Design and create data model for fictitious music company called Sparkify based on the STAR schema. Build Python ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) process in Python to load the data model. This project was for the Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree.<br/>

[Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra](Cassandra%20NoSQL/README.md) &nbsp;&nbsp; :white_check_mark:<br/>
-&nbsp;Ingest large amounts of data into NoSQL database called Apache Cassandra. Design is based on query-first approach for design of load processes into data tables in Cassandra.<br/>

[HDFS Command Line](HDFS-Command-Line/README.md) &nbsp;&nbsp; :hourglass_flowing_sand:<br/>
 -&nbsp;A practice project for HDFS Command line.

[Data Ingestion Kafka and Flume](Data-Ingestion_Kafka_Flume/README.md) &nbsp;&nbsp; :white_check_mark:<br/>
-&nbsp;This project is from SimpliLearn Big Data Hadoop and Spark Developer certification. It details steps for setting up a data ingestion process between Kafka and Flume.<br/>

[Market Analysis in Banking Domain](Market-Analysis-Banking/README.md) &nbsp;&nbsp; :white_check_mark:<br/>
-&nbsp;Assessment project for SimpliLearn Big Data Hadoop and Spark Developer certification. Use Apache Spark to analyze the results of marketing campaign performed by a Portuguese banking institution.<br/>

[Data Gathering Project using Python](Data-Gathering-Python/README.md) &nbsp;&nbsp; :hourglass_flowing_sand:<br/>
-&nbsp;A prerequisite project for the Udacity Data Engineering capstone project.  Use Python Beautiful Soup package library to extract Gapminder and COVID-19 data files.<br/>

[Capstone Project](https://github.com/mwalbers1/DEND-Capstone-Project) &nbsp;&nbsp; :white_check_mark:<br/>
-&nbsp;The final project to Udacity's Data Engineering Nanodegree.
